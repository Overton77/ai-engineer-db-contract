# knowledge_service.guard_checkpoint_scope

Domain `knowledge-service-runtime`.

## guard_checkpoint_scope() → trigger

function, volatile, security invoker, language plpgsql, config `search_path=""`.

No arguments.

Execute: `anon`, `app_reader`, `authenticated`, `control_plane`, `executor_service`, `pipeline_agent`, `service_role`, `verifier_agent`.

Raises (mechanically extracted): `checkpoint head requires the next committed revision`; `checkpoint scope identity is immutable`; `checkpoint scopes are retained`.

Touches (best effort): reads [`knowledge_service.scoped_checkpoint`](../../relations/knowledge_service/scoped_checkpoint.md); writes —; calls —.
