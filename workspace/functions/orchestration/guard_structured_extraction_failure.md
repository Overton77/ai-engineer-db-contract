function, volatile, security invoker, language plpgsql, config `search_path=""`.

No arguments.

Execute: `anon`, `app_reader`, `authenticated`, `control_plane`, `executor_service`, `pipeline_agent`, `service_role`, `verifier_agent`.

Raises (mechanically extracted): `structured extraction failure accounting drift`; `structured extraction failure active claim required`; `structured extraction failure identity is immutable`; `structured extraction failure is immutable`; `structured extraction failure lifecycle or classification mismatch`; `structured extraction failure must initialize first`; `structured extraction failure operation not active`; `structured extraction failure provider mismatch`; `structured extraction failure publication semantic mismatch`; `structured extraction failure stale lease`; `structured extraction failure typed source required`.
