# orchestration.structured_extraction_failure_terminal_guard

Domain `orchestration-ledger`.

## structured_extraction_failure_terminal_guard() → trigger

function, volatile, security invoker, language plpgsql, config `search_path=""`.

No arguments.

Execute: `anon`, `app_reader`, `authenticated`, `control_plane`, `executor_service`, `pipeline_agent`, `service_role`, `verifier_agent`.

Raises (mechanically extracted): `captured extraction failure cannot requeue`; `captured extraction failure requires exactly one step`; `structured extraction operation failure requires one exact receipt`; `structured extraction terminal output binding mismatch`; `structured extraction terminal requires published custody and active claim`; `structured extraction terminal stale lease`; `structured extraction terminal step binding mismatch`.

Touches (best effort): reads [`knowledge_service.lease`](../../relations/knowledge_service/lease.md), [`knowledge_service.operation`](../../relations/knowledge_service/operation.md), [`knowledge_service.operation_step`](../../relations/knowledge_service/operation_step.md), [`knowledge_service.receipt`](../../relations/knowledge_service/receipt.md), [`orchestration.verification_structured_extraction`](../../relations/orchestration/verification_structured_extraction.md), [`orchestration.verification_structured_extraction_failure`](../../relations/orchestration/verification_structured_extraction_failure.md); writes —; calls [`orchestration.structured_extraction_failure_result_body`](structured_extraction_failure_result_body.md), [`orchestration.structured_extraction_receipt_json`](structured_extraction_receipt_json.md).
