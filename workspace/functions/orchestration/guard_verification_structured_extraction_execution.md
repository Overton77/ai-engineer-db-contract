# orchestration.guard_verification_structured_extraction_execution

Domain `orchestration-ledger`.

## guard_verification_structured_extraction_execution() → trigger

function, volatile, security invoker, language plpgsql, config `search_path=""`.

No arguments.

Execute: `anon`, `app_reader`, `authenticated`, `control_plane`, `executor_service`, `pipeline_agent`, `service_role`, `verifier_agent`.

Touches (best effort): reads [`knowledge_service.lease`](../../relations/knowledge_service/lease.md), [`knowledge_service.operation`](../../relations/knowledge_service/operation.md), [`knowledge_service.operation_step`](../../relations/knowledge_service/operation_step.md), [`orchestration.artifact`](../../relations/orchestration/artifact.md), [`orchestration.verification_artifact_metadata`](../../relations/orchestration/verification_artifact_metadata.md), [`orchestration.verification_provider_attempt`](../../relations/orchestration/verification_provider_attempt.md); writes —; calls [`orchestration.verification_artifact_is_admitted`](verification_artifact_is_admitted.md).
