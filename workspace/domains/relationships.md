# Relationships

One relationship table; kinds constrain endpoints and may carry a relationship_active stream.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — `corpus.relationship` is the only edge table. `kind` references
> `taxonomy.relationship_kind`, which lists `from_kinds`, `to_kinds`, whether the edge
> is temporal, and a `property_schema`. Trigger `relationship_kinds` rejects illegal
> endpoint kinds (SQLSTATE 23514). Current edges have `k_to` null; the unique current
> key is `(tenant, kind, from, to, qualifier, episode)`.
> 
> Temporal kinds also need an active `relationship_active` stream on the relationship
> subject. `api.relationships` and `api.current_relationships` hide temporal edges that
> are not active at the requested world time. Non-temporal kinds (`offered_as`,
> `version_of`, `founded`) are current whenever `k_to` is null.
> 
> Read with `q:entity.relationships` (direction both, outgoing, incoming) or
> `q:relationships.current_by_kind`. Check `q:vocab.relationship_kind` before composing
> a relationship.assert proposal. Properties must satisfy property_schema via
> `temporal.payload_valid`. version_of additionally requires a matching pair
> (product_version/product, ai_model_version/ai_model, and so on).
> 
> Facets and terms in `taxonomy` classify entities, knowledge records, or lessons
> through `taxonomy.assignment`; they are not substitutes for relationship kinds.
> `corpus.media_appearance` is a timed mention of an entity inside a media work, not a
> `relationship` row. Agents never insert edges; `temporal.assert_relationship` runs as
> `executor_service` inside a batch.
