# Ranking and metrics

Entity-keyed metric observations and ranking results.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — Observations land on `ranking.metric_observation`: a versioned metric definition, a
> `subject_entity_id`, a numeric value, `observed_at`, and optional claim/locator.
> Feature values and ranking results (`ranking.ranking_result`) are computed artifacts
> of a `ranking.ranking_run` under a policy. `api.leaderboard` returns current
> `ranking.ranking_result` rows for the tenant.
> 
> Control tables (groups, policies, selections, leaderboard editions) remain for
> runtime. They are not a place to assert industry facts. A price belongs on
> `model_offering_price`; a benchmark score that should be a first-class identity may
> also be a `corpus.benchmark_run` plus relationships.
> 
> Ingestion uses metric.observe. Writers are executor_service. Agents read
> leaderboard and observation rows when comparing models or libraries, and they cite
> the claim that backs the number. `ranking.metric_definition` plus
> `ranking.metric_definition_version` are the vocabulary for those numbers; do not
> invent a unit that the version does not define. Group membership tables still
> point at corpus entities and are not a second identity system.
> 
> Invariant: an observation without `subject_entity_id` cannot join the leaderboard.
> Trap: treating `api.leaderboard` as current world facts — it is a computed ranking
> snapshot. After `what-do-we-know-about-entity` / `q:entity.card`, come here only
> when the question is “how does this entity score on a defined metric,” then cite
> the backing claim on the observation. Writers use metric.observe inside a batch.
