# Observability

Traces, spans, and normalized runtime events (month-partitioned).

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — Observability stores traces, spans, raw and normalized events, usage rollups, IO
> links, and coordinator handoffs. Event and span tables are month-partitioned
> (`observability.normalized_event`, `observability.span`, `observability.raw_event`).
> This is runtime telemetry for missions and executors, not industry knowledge.
> 
> Agents debugging a failed ingest should look here only after the receipt and
> knowledge head. Do not copy span attributes into `temporal.segment`. Normalized
> events are the query surface; raw events are the append-only capture.
> `observability.usage_rollup` aggregates tokens and cost for experiment metrics.
> `observability.coordinator_handoff` records where a durable worker paused. None of
> these relations are named-query catalog targets today; operators read them as
> pipeline_agent when diagnosing executor failures.
> 
> Invariant: partitions are monthly; queries without a time bound scan every
> child. Trap: copying a span attribute into a fact stream. After
> `check-knowledge-head` / `q:knowledge.head`, look at
> `observability.normalized_event` for executor errors, then
> `observability.io_link` for the artifact or RPC the step touched. Usage rollups
> feed experiment cost, not `ranking.metric_observation`. This domain is
> diagnostic only — it never admits industry knowledge.
