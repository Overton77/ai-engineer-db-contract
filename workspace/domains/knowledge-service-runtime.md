# Knowledge service runtime

Durable KS operations, steps, outbox, and eve bindings.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — `knowledge_service.operation` is the durable record of a platform or eve call
> (operation_kind, idempotency_key, ownership_mode standalone | mission_control | eve,
> attempt_id, request_sha256, status). Steps and events decompose the run. The outbox
> emits knowledge.batch_sealed when a temporal batch commits and projection.rebuilt
> when retrieval projections refresh.
> 
> Leases, callback deliveries, and eve operation bindings are runtime control. Agents
> do not write these tables. The knowledge executor records a
> `knowledge_ingestion` operation when it applies an intent. Ownership_mode is `eve`
> in the experiment and `mission_control` when Mission Control calls.
> 
> If a batch sealed but an artifact upload is pending, the artifact row keeps
> `storage_state='pending'` and a retry step finishes it. Receipts live in Postgres
> even when object storage lags.
> 
> Invariant: one operation row per idempotency_key. Trap: treating the outbox as a
> query catalog — agents should `check-knowledge-head` / `q:knowledge.head` after a
> sealed batch instead of polling `knowledge_service.outbox`. `temporal.emit_outbox`
> runs inside `temporal.commit_batch`; do not call it yourself. Eve bindings
> (`knowledge_service.eve_operation_binding`) record proving-ground ownership and
> are not a write path for research agents. When diagnosis needs more than the
> head, read `knowledge_service.operation_step` as pipeline_agent.
