# Staging and identity resolution

Candidates for new identities, not a staging copy of facts.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — `staging.candidate` holds a proposed kind, payload, optional source, and optional
> resolved entity. It is the identity-resolution zone. It is not a draft `temporal.segment`.
> `staging.identity_match` records scored matches. `staging.resolution_decision`
> (create, match, reject, defer) and `staging.vetting_decision` (admit, reject, defer)
> each require a receipt.
> 
> `q:staging.unresolved` lists candidates with no create/match/reject decision.
> `q:staging.candidates_for_kind` filters by `proposed_kind`. Low-confidence resolve
> results should become candidate.stage (rule stage.when_confidence_below_threshold)
> instead of entity.create.
> 
> `proposed_kind` must exist in `taxonomy.entity_kind`. Pipeline agents may insert
> candidates; only the executor writes decisions with a receipt. Evaluation review
> tasks can point at a candidate. Do not park an uncertain price here — use belief
> disputed or stage only the unknown organization.
> 
> Invariant: a candidate is not an entity until `staging.resolution_decision` is
> create or match. Trap: calling `q:entity.resolve` and treating a mid-score hit as
> a create. Use `stage-uncertain-candidate` and `q:staging.unresolved` /
> `q:staging.candidates_for_kind` until a human or identity pass decides. Then
> `resolve-or-create-entity` can emit entity.create only for the admitted id. The
> source_id on the candidate should point at the `evidence.source` that mentioned
> the name, so later merges have a quote.
