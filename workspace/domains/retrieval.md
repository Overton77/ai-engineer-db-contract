# Vector retrieval

Published 1536-d spaces, hybrid search, and evidence packets.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — Spaces (`retrieval.vector_space` slugs such as engineering_claims, entity_profiles,
> market_intelligence) have versions and store attachments
> (`retrieval.vector_store_space.active_space_version_id`). `retrieval.vector_item`
> rows are what hybrid search ranks; child halfvec partitions are not a direct read
> path for bounded roles. Publication (`retrieval.space_publication`, status published)
> is the gate: `api.hybrid_knowledge_search_1536` refuses unpublished versions.
> 
> `q:retrieval.hybrid_search` fuses exact, full-text, trigram, and ANN channels with
> RRF. The catalog entry needs a query embedding (`paramOrder` starts with `$embedding`,
> `execute: false`). Agents pass `query_text` and a `vector_space_version_id`; the
> executor embeds. Optional filters include entity ids, document types, content kinds,
> as-of time, knowledge_seq, min assurance, and publication id.
> 
> Chunks, spans, and search projections are the derived text. `q:retrieval.evidence_packet`
> returns one packet plus members, joining `content.document_node` timecodes when
> present. Projection rebuilds emit a projection.rebuilt event on the knowledge-service
> outbox. Agents never write embeddings.
> 
> Invariant: unpublished versions are invisible to `app_reader`. Trap: passing a
> `vector_space` id where a `retrieval.vector_space_version` id is required, or
> expecting `q:retrieval.hybrid_search` to embed the query in-database. Use
> `run-hybrid-search` for ranking and `build-evidence-packet` when you already have
> a packet id. Filters for entity ids, document types, as-of time, knowledge_seq,
> and min assurance live in the jsonb argument, not as extra SQL.
