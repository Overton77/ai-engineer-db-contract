# Orchestration ledger

Missions, intents, immutable receipts, and content-addressed artifacts.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — `orchestration.operation_intent` records intent_type (including knowledge_ingestion),
> schema_version, payload, preconditions, unique `idempotency_key`, optional mission and
> attempt, and approval_state. `orchestration.operation_receipt` is one-to-one with an
> intent and immutable: outcome applied, rejected, noop, or partial, plus
> changes_summary and affected_refs. Facts cannot exist without a receipt id.
> 
> `orchestration.artifact` is content-addressed (sha256, bucket_class, storage_bucket,
> unique object_path) and typed by `orchestration.artifact_type` (knowledge_read_intent,
> knowledge_read_snapshot, knowledge_ingestion_plan, knowledge_ingestion_receipt,
> schema_workspace_manifest, knowledge_report_markdown, and older codes). Lineage
> (`orchestration.artifact_lineage`) records derived_from, supersedes, corrects,
> produced_by, consumed_by.
> 
> pipeline_agent can select intents and artifacts but not receipt rows. `q:receipts.for_intent`
> therefore joins the intent to `temporal.knowledge_batch` on idempotency_key to expose
> receipt_id and knowledge_seq. Missions, attempts, work items, and capabilities are
> the durable envelope; this workspace does not create Mission Control spine objects.
> 
> Invariant: two intents cannot share an idempotency_key. Trap: treating
> `orchestration.operation_receipt` as readable under `pipeline_agent` — it is not;
> use `q:receipts.for_intent` or `q:receipts.recent_for_mission`. Before writing,
> `check-knowledge-head` then `publish-report` for report artifacts. `q:artifacts.by_type`
> lists stored objects; bytes are fetched through the executor, never with bucket
> credentials. A knowledge_ingestion intent is what the executor records when it
> applies a schema-workspace plan.
