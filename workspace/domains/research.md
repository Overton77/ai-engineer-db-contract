# Research reports

Immutable research packages, reusable sections, evidence bindings, coverage and ingestion lineage.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — research.report is the identity; report_version is immutable. Versions without a
> report_package remain legacy reports. Package v1 adds scope, cutoff, producer,
> sections, assertions, coverage and an ordered predecessor.
> 
> Read path: task:navigate-report maps the reports.* queries below to parameters and
> result shapes. Select a revision, read its ordered sections, then follow assertion
> spans to run-qualified evidence or questions to answering sections and gaps.
> KS report_get assembles packages; queries return at most 200 rows.
> 
> Write path: task:register-report uses KS report_register for research-report.v1.
> Both authoring modes support optional missions and require new revisions for edits.
> The structural seal freezes projections; it is not verification or admission.
> Partial reports retain gaps. Post-seal assessments bind exact-byte result artifacts;
> ingestion links connect reportBinding proposals to receipts and canonical outcomes.
> Interpret verdicts at the verification/policy owner, never from link presence alone.
> 
> task:publish-report is the legacy compatibility path.
