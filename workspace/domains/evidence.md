# Source and evidence lineage

Source to capture to locator to claim; facts attach through segment_support.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — Lineage is `evidence.source` → `evidence.source_capture` (artifact_id, content_sha256,
> capture_method) → `evidence.locator` (selector, selected_content_sha256) →
> `evidence.claim`. `evidence.claim_subject` names entities as subject, object, or
> context. Canonical facts attach a `primary_claim_id` and, separately, k-stamped
> `evidence.segment_support` rows that point at a segment or an event occurrence plus a
> locator.
> 
> Discovery leads are `evidence.source_query` → `evidence.provider_result` →
> `evidence.source_encounter`. Capture methods and search providers are vocabularies.
> `evidence.verification_run` is the sealed-run ledger that ingestion cites; unsealed
> or failing verdicts are `EVIDENCE_NOT_ELIGIBLE`.
> 
> app_reader cannot see evidence tables. Use `q:evidence.claims_for_entity` and
> `q:evidence.claim_support` as pipeline_agent, or the claim/source slices inside
> `q:entity.card`. Inserts into source/capture/locator/claim are permitted to
> pipeline_agent and executor_service; `evidence.segment_support` is helper-only
> (`temporal.admit_support`) and is stamped by `temporal.stamp_k`.
> 
> Traps: do not treat a verification filesystem run as already in `evidence.claim`.
> Materialize cited claims first. Support role on the table is supports, challenges, or
> context. Nine evidence tables are insert-only. Reach for
> `q:evidence.claims_for_entity` when you already have an entity id, then
> `q:evidence.claim_support` to see which segments that claim currently backs.
> `admit-support-for-claim` is the write path; `build-evidence-packet` is the read
> path that assembles locators for a question. Discovery queries
> (`q:evidence.sources_by_domain`, `q:evidence.captures_for_source`) are how you
> walk from a registrable domain to the bytes you would quote.
