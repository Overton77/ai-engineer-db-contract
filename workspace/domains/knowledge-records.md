# Knowledge records

Typed engineering records linked to entities, created only with a receipt.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — `knowledge.record` is the identity of an engineering statement (kind, title,
> statement, assurance_level, scope, provenance_claim_id). Nine typed children hold
> problems, solution patterns, implementation examples, failure modes, benchmark
> results, compatibility constraints, operational practices, security considerations,
> and advanced usage patterns. `knowledge.record_entity_link` attaches records to
> corpus entities.
> 
> Only `executor_service` creates records, and `created_by_receipt_id` is required.
> `api.technical_record_search` exposes `knowledge.record` to `app_reader`. Assurance
> vocabulary (`knowledge.assurance_level`) is shared with retrieval filters.
> 
> These records are not temporal segments. A price or availability fact belongs in
> `temporal.segment`. A how-to-call-the-API pattern belongs here, linked to the
> product or library entity and backed by a claim. Curriculum lessons point at these
> typed rows through `curriculum.lesson_backed_by`. `knowledge.record_reconciliation`
> remains for runtime repair of older records. Reach for this domain after
> `q:entity.card` when the question is an engineering practice rather than a dated
> world fact; then follow `knowledge.record_entity_link` to the subject entity.
> 
> Invariant: no record without `created_by_receipt_id`. Trap: writing a benchmark
> number here when it is actually a `ranking.metric_observation` or a
> `corpus.benchmark_run`. Agents do not DML these tables; they author a knowledge
> record proposal after `what-do-we-know-about-entity` shows the linked identity.
