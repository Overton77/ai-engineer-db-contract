# Research-starter protected

Protected pre-research starter catalog and factory tables; do not mutate.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — `public` holds twenty-five protected research-starter / pre-research tables and
> sixteen retained factory tables. Both YouTube channels and all starter videos are
> unchanged by the knowledge-model migrations. `research_private` holds the pipeline
> routines that claim videos, checkpoint stages, and list finished packets.
> 
> This is intake, not the canonical graph. `corpus.import_research_starter_catalog`
> can project channels and videos into media identities, but it was not run on the
> shared cloud catalog and must not invent capture hashes. Factory tables such as
> `public.factory_experiment` record canaries and promotions for the retained factory,
> not industry facts.
> 
> Agents on the schema-workspace mission should treat these relations as read-only
> context. Do not add migrations here. Do not confuse `public.research_ingestion_intent`
> with `orchestration.operation_intent`. Transcript bytes live in storage buckets, not
> in these tables.
> 
> Invariant: starter channel and video ids are stable across knowledge-model
> migrations. Trap: treating a pre-research packet as already-admitted corpus
> knowledge. Resolve names with `q:entity.resolve` / `what-do-we-know-about-entity`
> after import, never by joining factory tables. `research_private` routines are
> for the starter pipeline only; they are not temporal helpers. Do not confuse
> `public.research_evidence_anchor` with `evidence.locator`. Operators may read
> these tables as context; writers on this mission must not mutate them.
