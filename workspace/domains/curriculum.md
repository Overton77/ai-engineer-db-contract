# Curriculum

Learning paths that point at concepts and knowledge records.

> curated (model_assisted, unreviewed) — Curriculum is tracks, modules, versioned lessons, challenges, and learning
> objectives. `curriculum.lesson_covers_concept` and `curriculum.challenge_targets`
> reference `corpus.entity` (often kind concept, library, mcp_server, agent_skill).
> `curriculum.lesson_backed_by` points at typed knowledge records so a lesson is
> grounded in admitted engineering knowledge.
> 
> Lessons are not claims and not temporal facts. When a lesson cites a product
> behavior, the behavior still lives on a stream; the lesson only links. Agents
> building official courses should resolve the concept entity first, then attach
> backing records that already have receipts. `curriculum.lesson_prerequisite` and
> `curriculum.challenge_derived_from` keep the graph of what a learner must already
> know. Do not create a lesson that names a library the corpus cannot resolve.
> 
> Invariant: a lesson version is immutable; edits create `curriculum.lesson_version`
> rows. Trap: putting a product availability date on a lesson — that date belongs
> on `temporal.stream_kind:model_offering_availability`. Start with
> `what-do-we-know-about-entity` / `q:entity.card` for the concept, then attach
> backing records that already have receipts. Challenges
> (`curriculum.challenge`, `curriculum.challenge_version`) target the same
> identities. Official courses are agent-native: they must resolve the concept
> before they name it in prose.
