## View definition

```sql
SELECT event_id,
    tenant_id,
    kind,
    subject_entity_id,
    object_entity_id,
    occurrence_id,
    occurred_during,
    occurrence_mode,
    payload
   FROM api.current_event_rows() current_event_rows(event_id, tenant_id, kind, subject_entity_id, object_entity_id, occurrence_id, occurred_during, occurrence_mode, payload);
```

## TypeScript

row: `Database["api"]["Views"]["events_current"]["Row"]`

## Examples

Events for one subject

```bash
knowledge db query events.current_for_entity --param entity_id=0192b000-0000-7000-8000-000000000001
```
Filters the view by subject_entity_id.
