# Publish a report through the legacy compatibility proposal

Domains: [`research`](../domains/research.md), [`orchestration-ledger`](../domains/orchestration-ledger.md). Queries: [`q:artifacts.by_type`](../queries/README.md), [`q:receipts.for_intent`](../queries/README.md), [`q:receipts.recent_for_mission`](../queries/README.md).

## Navigation

`domains/research.md` → `domains/orchestration-ledger.md`

## Operation

For v1 authoring use task:register-report. This page describes the older report.publish compatibility path; it does not create a v1 package.

      "claimIds": ["c_0007", "c_0009", "c_0011"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Expected shape

`research.report` plus `research.report_version` (markdown artifact) and `research.report_claim` rows. Receipt lists created ids. Staged: `mission_id` is required today.

## Pitfalls

Publish only a verification-run registered report artifact. Do not insert `research.report` yourself. Claims must already be materialized.
