# Semantic code map

Generated from reviewed module descriptions and current selected source files. Package dependencies/exports/script names are extracted from manifests; relationships and ownership are authored. This is not a complete import graph or proof that a designed capability is implemented.

Paths below are repository-relative. Use the task routes, then search the module heading. Follow accepted architecture docs for decisions; proposed/reference/deprecated documents retain those labels.

## Task routes

- Change shared schema: [schema](#schema) → [type-generation](#type-generation) → [type-contract](#type-contract)
- Investigate reset restrictions: [reset-guard](#reset-guard)
- Change the schema workspace generator or enrichment: [schema-workspace-generator](#schema-workspace-generator) → [schema](#schema)

## Modules

## type-contract

**src** · module · implemented

Type-only Database/API/pre-research exports and provenance constants/helpers.

**Enter:** [`src/index.ts`](../../src/index.ts), [`src/api.ts`](../../src/api.ts), [`src/pre-research.ts`](../../src/pre-research.ts)
**Interface:** Package exports for pinned database consumers.
**Package:** @aiengineer/database-contract ([`package.json`](../../package.json))
**Export subpaths:** ., ./api, ./pre-research, ./provenance, ./reports. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** none declared
**Other runtime dependencies:** none declared
**Reviewed runtime/data relationships:** none declared
**Checks:** No specific test anchor registered. Package script names: db:migrate, db:reset, db:start, test, typecheck, types:check, types:check:native, types:generate, types:generate:native, workspace:build, workspace:check, workspace:materialize, workspace:validate.
- database.generated.ts is generated output; inspect it explicitly when needed rather than including its full contents in the map.

## schema

**supabase** · module · implemented

Shared Supabase configuration and ordered migration authority.

**Package:** not a standalone package
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** none declared
**Other runtime dependencies:** none declared
**Reviewed runtime/data relationships:** none declared
**Checks:** [`supabase/tests/verification_evaluation_dataset_manifest.sql`](../../supabase/tests/verification_evaluation_dataset_manifest.sql)

## type-generation

**scripts** · module · implemented

Supabase/native type generation and drift checking.

**Enter:** [`scripts/generate-types.mjs`](../../scripts/generate-types.mjs), [`scripts/generate-types-native.mjs`](../../scripts/generate-types-native.mjs)
**Interface:** Generation/check scripts with explicit database-target validation.
**Package:** not a standalone package
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** none declared
**Other runtime dependencies:** none declared
**Reviewed runtime/data relationships:** [schema](#schema), [type-contract](#type-contract)
**Checks:** No specific test anchor registered.

## reset-guard

**scripts** · module · implemented

Allows reset only for explicitly disposable databases.

**Enter:** [`scripts/reset-disposable-local.mjs`](../../scripts/reset-disposable-local.mjs)
**Interface:** Guarded local reset executable.
**Package:** not a standalone package
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** none declared
**Other runtime dependencies:** none declared
**Reviewed runtime/data relationships:** none declared
**Checks:** [`scripts/reset-disposable-local.test.mjs`](../../scripts/reset-disposable-local.test.mjs)
- Never use a map or a documentation job to bypass the shared-data reset guard.

## schema-workspace-generator

**scripts/schema-workspace** · scripts · implemented

Introspects pg_catalog into schema-ir.v1, merges curated enrichment, renders the committed workspace, and checks or validates drift; owns the committed workspace/ tree (ai-engineer-schema-workspace/3), which is read by id starting at workspace/manifest.json and never enumerated.

**Enter:** [`scripts/schema-workspace/cli.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/cli.mjs), [`scripts/schema-workspace/lib/pipeline.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/lib/pipeline.mjs), [`scripts/schema-workspace/lib/ir/build-ir.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/lib/ir/build-ir.mjs), [`scripts/schema-workspace/lib/render/render-workspace.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/lib/render/render-workspace.mjs), [`scripts/schema-workspace/lib/validate.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/lib/validate.mjs), [`scripts/schema-workspace/lib/selection.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/lib/selection.mjs), [`scripts/schema-workspace/README.md`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/README.md), [`workspace.config.json`](../../workspace.config.json), [`workspace-enrichment/README.md`](../../workspace-enrichment/README.md), [`workspace-enrichment/domains.yaml`](../../workspace-enrichment/domains.yaml), [`workspace-enrichment/queries.yaml`](../../workspace-enrichment/queries.yaml), [`workspace-scopes/db-aware-research.json`](../../workspace-scopes/db-aware-research.json)
**Interface:** cli.mjs: introspect, build, check, validate, materialize, enrich. npm workspace:build, workspace:check, workspace:validate, workspace:materialize. Enrichment also has relations, terminology, tasks, ingestion-rules YAML; scopes also has full.json and ingestion-author.json.
**Package:** not a standalone package
**Export subpaths:** none declared. Declared metadata; build outputs are not read.
**Declared internal package dependencies:** none declared
**Other runtime dependencies:** none declared
**Reviewed runtime/data relationships:** [schema](#schema), [type-contract](#type-contract)
**Checks:** [`scripts/schema-workspace/test/helpers.test.mjs`](../../scripts/schema-workspace/test/helpers.test.mjs)
- workspace/ is generated by npm run workspace:build; edit workspace-enrichment/ or the generator, never the tree.
- workspace/ contains only generator output: CI fails on drift (workspace:check) or on any file the generator did not render (workspace:validate).
